            CS Senior @ Purdue, previously interning at Tesla, NASA, and AWS. 
            In my final semester of CS, I'm hoping to learn a bunch more about fundamental CS topics, specifically Compilers and Databases! 
            In the past, I really enjoyed coursework with ML, Algorithms, and OS, but I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone :).

            Professionally I've been all over the place, I've recently just completed an internship at Tesla where I worked as a full-stack dev on the Energy Product Software Team.
            I have realized that I learn best by doing, and my 'doing'-focuses primarily on my foundations of CS until I graduate, and hopefully tackling fun problems aftewards!
