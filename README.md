# vue_portfolio

The second iteration of my website! Written in Vue.js as a Single Page
application. This is a more forced version of the site, since I wrote this up
on a different repo originally, but you should be able to pick apart most of
this site if you clone it yourself.

I've left the old website I had under the ``version_1`` branch (should be
accessible above) just incase I want to go back to it, but I'm honestly a huge
fan of this current site

Installation should be straightfoward if you want to look around here.
