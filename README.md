# Hugo version of the website

Shouldve done this earlier, really liked this idea. Combines blog with my current resume type website, and it looks kinda flexible

## Setting up:

make sure to do the submodule thing (should be in .gitmodules):

```
git rm --cached themes/hugo-profile

git submodule add https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile themes/hugo-profile
```

Have fun!
