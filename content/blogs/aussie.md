# What

I've been traveling throughout Australia for the past 3 and a half weeks, visiting for the most part and spending the final week or so with family.

# Why?

It's been one of those core-memory experiences, so I've been feeling the need to write some of it down.

# Lessons

## Sydney

-   pushing physical limits and also overcoming fears

## Queensland

-   trying things that are just completely unknown, going for "once in a lifetime" type experiences

## Tasmania

Nature things

-   getting uncomfortable going further than normal
-   trying to actually see things all in all

## Canberra, New Years Day

-   nana and nani being awesome, cool to see my mom in a position that hasn't been head of household
-   family dynamic I'm not used to seeing at all

-   interesting dynamic between the two brothers
-   advice I got about being able to tread the line between abandoning parents and being retarded as I get older
