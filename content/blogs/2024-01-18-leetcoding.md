## Backtracking

It's like DFS but where we track the state as well, I really really liked this
[Leetcode card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/2793/)

Problems and why I think they matter

picking up the template
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/
[this one requires an additional structure!](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

Optimizing pruning strategy:

https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/submissions/1145152116/
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/submissions/1145139692/


## Fundamental Graphs
Super important as this structure is actually used in real life. I sometimes
imagine what it would be like to solve one of these for starlink or something
haha.

Kahn's Algorithm

I really liked this [explore card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/graph/623/kahns-algorithm-for-topological-sorting/3886/) on it and explaining why its good as
a pruning strategy.
