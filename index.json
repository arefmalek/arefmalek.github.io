This would mean a lot of what I wrote had to be asynchronous. At first I thought this would be super serious, but the concept is more straightforward than I thought. Essentially a statement in Python that would look like this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003esleep(500);\nprint(\u0026#34;Hi ma!\u0026#34;);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe interpreter would stall for half a second before printing the statement. However in Javascript, a single thread would deal with the sleep statement and another would print time, so implementing my operations like this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eif (leftLessThanRight(num1, num2) === true) {\n    swap(num1, num2);\n    sleep(time);\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003ejust would not work from the jump. However, \u003ccode\u003easync\u003c/code\u003e functions solve this issue entirely by making code operate the way I mentioned in the first sample (alongside adding \u003ccode\u003eawait\u003c/code\u003e to the function call).
